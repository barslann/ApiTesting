API Testing
     Here are some common areas that can be tested in API testing:

     1. Endpoint functionality:
        Ensure that each API endpoint performs the intended functionality as specified in the API documentation.
        This includes testing different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and verifying that the responses adhere to the expected behavior.


        Example: Test the functionality of a user registration API endpoint. Send a POST request with valid user data and
                 assert that the response contains the expected success message or status code.

     2.Request and response validation:
        Validate that the API requests and responses are correctly formatted, include the required parameters, headers,
        and body content, and follow any specified data structures (such as JSON or XML).

        Example: Validate that a GET request to retrieve a user profile returns the expected
                JSON response structure and includes the required fields such as name, email, and date of birth.

     3.Error handling:
        Test how the API handles various error scenarios, such as sending invalid or missing parameters, unauthorized requests, and server errors.
        Validate that appropriate error codes, messages, and response formats are returned.

        Example: Send a POST request to create a user without providing a required parameter, such as the email address. Assert that the
                API responds with an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and an error message indicating the missing parameter.

     4.Authentication and authorization:
        Verify that authentication mechanisms, such as API keys, tokens, or OAuth, are correctly implemented and
        restrict access to authorized users. Test different authentication scenarios and ensure that unauthorized requests are rejected

        Example: Test an API that requires an API key for authentication. Send a request without providing a valid API key
                 and verify that the API returns a response with a 401 Unauthorized status code.

     5.Data manipulation: //User
        Test the ability to create, read, update, and delete data through the API (CRUD operations).
        Validate that data is stored correctly and consistently, and changes made through the API are reflected in subsequent requests.

        Example: Perform a series of API requests to create, update, and delete a user. Verify that the user is successfully created,
                 updated with new information, and finally deleted, with appropriate response codes and data validation checks along the way.

     6.Data validation:
        Check that the API validates input data, performs necessary data transformations, and enforces data constraints and business rules.
        Test various data scenarios, including edge cases and boundary values.

        Example: Test an API endpoint that accepts a date parameter. Send requests with different date formats, invalid dates, and
                boundary values to ensure the API correctly validates the input and responds accordingly.

     7. Performance and scalability:
        Assess the API's performance by conducting load testing, stress testing, and measuring response times under different traffic conditions.
        Verify that the API can handle a high volume of requests and monitor its performance metrics.

        Example: Conduct load testing on an API by simulating a high volume of concurrent requests. Measure the response times, identify any performance bottlenecks,
                and monitor server resources to assess the API's scalability and performance under load.

     8.Security:
        Conduct security testing to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other potential security risks.
        Validate that the API follows security best practices and protects against common attack vectors.

        Example: Perform security testing by attempting SQL injection attacks on an API endpoint that accepts user input.
                Verify that the API properly sanitizes inputs and rejects malicious attempts, preventing any unauthorized access or data breaches.

     9.API integration:
        Test how well the API integrates with other systems, databases, or third-party services.
        Validate that data is correctly exchanged, and API interactions function as expected in real-world integration scenarios.


        Example: Test the integration between an e-commerce API and a payment gateway. Verify that successful order placement through the API triggers the payment processing on the gateway,
                 and confirm that the API receives the appropriate response indicating the payment status.
